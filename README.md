  Hello there!
</h1>

<p align="center">
  I am Aven, a game developer that spends most of my time inside Unity making games.  <br> <br>
  When I'm not making games I am most likely working on a side project you may or may <br>
  not be able to find here. When I do finish a side project I'll try to leave the repository  <br>
  public and open-source it for others. That being said I haven't had many projects leave <br>
  the WIP state.

	This was probably one of the more fun times I've had programming in recent years. The 
	code itself is by no means hard to create nor is there a complex algorithm or anything 
	of the sorts. I whooped it up in about 20-30 minutes, I had a big deadline on making an
	application that can read faulty Shopify websites. People might misinterpret this as making 
	a bot to buy something when it drops but that is by no means what it is nor what it is 
	intended for. I still don't consider this one fully finished as there are a lot of user 
	enhancements to be made and not a lot of documentation explaining the proper ways to use it.

	Poong was interesting to me more as a joke, I learned a lot more about what you can do with
	the C# command line from this project however. It is definitely by no means finished, the ball
	can bounce, you can move your paddle, but there isn't a game loop implemented nor an enemy paddle.
	The tick system was very fun to implement and I thoroughly enjoyed this tiny Summer project.
